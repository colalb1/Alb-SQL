### Deep Technical Analysis of Components

#### 1. Schema Analogizer

The Schema Analogizer implements a novel cross-database meta-learning approach that identifies analogical relationships between schema elements across different databases.

**Mathematical Foundation:**

Schema elements are represented as vectors in a high-dimensional embedding space:

$$\mathbf{e}_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^d$$

Where $\mathbf{e}_{i}$ is the embedding of element $i$ and $d$ is the embedding dimension (default: 768).

The similarity between two schema elements is computed using cosine similarity:

$$\text{sim}(e_i, e_j) = \frac{\mathbf{e}_i \cdot \mathbf{e}_j}{||\mathbf{e}_i|| \cdot ||\mathbf{e}_j||}$$

Elements are considered analogous when their similarity exceeds a threshold $\tau$ (default: 0.85):

$$\text{isAnalogous}(e_i, e_j) = \begin{cases} 
\text{True} & \text{if } \text{sim}(e_i, e_j) \geq \tau \\
\text{False} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

**Novel Implementation Details:**

The system constructs a "Schema Analogy Graph" $G = (V, E)$ where:
- $V$ represents all schema elements across databases
- $E$ contains weighted edges indicating analogical strength

This graph enables a unique form of cross-database knowledge transfer, allowing the system to leverage patterns learned from one database when generating SQL for another.

For example, identifying that "beds" in a healthcare database is analogous to "nodes" in a blockchain database allows transferring query patterns across seemingly unrelated domains.

The relationship strength between elements $i$ and $j$ is given by:

$$r_{ij} = \alpha \cdot \text{sim}(e_i, e_j) + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \text{struct}(e_i, e_j)$$

Where $\text{struct}(e_i, e_j)$ measures structural similarity in their database relationships, and $\alpha$ is a weighting factor (empirically set to 0.7).

#### 2. Execution-Aware Trainer

The Execution-Aware Trainer incorporates database execution results into the SQL generation process, optimizing for both syntactic correctness and execution efficiency.

**Mathematical Foundation:**

The SQL correctness loss function combines result similarity and execution plan similarity:

$$\mathcal{L}(\text{SQL}_{\text{gen}}, \text{SQL}_{\text{ref}}) = \beta \cdot (1 - R_{\text{sim}}) + (1 - \beta) \cdot (1 - P_{\text{sim}})$$

Where:
- $\text{SQL}_{\text{gen}}$ is the generated SQL
- $\text{SQL}_{\text{ref}}$ is the reference SQL
- $R_{\text{sim}}$ is the similarity between execution results
- $P_{\text{sim}}$ is the similarity between execution plans
- $\beta$ is a weighting factor (default: 0.7)

Result similarity is defined recursively for nested structures:

$$R_{\text{sim}} = \frac{\text{matching\_fields}(\text{SQL}_{\text{gen}}, \text{SQL}_{\text{ref}})}{\max(|\text{SQL}_{\text{gen}}|, |\text{SQL}_{\text{ref}}|)}$$

Plan similarity is computed using a specialized hierarchical comparison algorithm:

$$P_{\text{sim}} = \begin{cases} 
0.7 + 0.3 \cdot \frac{\min(c_1, c_2)}{\max(c_1, c_2)} & \text{if plan types match} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

Where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the costs of the respective execution plans.

**Novel Implementation Details:**

Traditional SQL generation approaches focus solely on string similarity or syntactic correctness. Our system is novel in that it introduces an execution-aware validation loop that considers:

1. **Row Equivalence**: Whether the queries return the same rows
2. **Execution Efficiency**: How efficiently the SQL executes
3. **Plan Similarity**: Whether the execution plans match structurally

This creates an optimization objective that aligns with real-world database performance:

$$\arg\min_{\text{SQL}} \mathcal{L}(\text{SQL}, \text{SQL}_{\text{ref}}) \quad \text{subject to} \quad \text{Rows}(\text{SQL}) = \text{Rows}(\text{SQL}_{\text{ref}})$$

The candidate evaluation metrics form a multi-dimensional scoring space:

$$\text{score}(\text{SQL}) = w_1 \cdot \text{syntax\_correctness} + w_2 \cdot \text{semantic\_correctness} + w_3 \cdot \text{result\_match} + w_4 \cdot \text{efficiency}$$

With empirically determined weights: $w_1 = 0.1, w_2 = 0.4, w_3 = 0.4, w_4 = 0.1$.

#### 3. Adaptive Context Manager

The Adaptive Context Manager dynamically allocates tokens based on query complexity to optimize the prompt context within available token limits.

**Mathematical Foundation:**

The token allocation function is defined as:

$$T_i = \max\left(\left\lfloor\frac{p_i \cdot T_{\text{max}}}{100}\right\rfloor, T_{\text{min},i}\right)$$

Where:
- $T_i$ is the token allocation for component $i$
- $p_i$ is the percentage allocation for component $i$ based on complexity
- $T_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum available tokens
- $T_{\text{min},i}$ is the minimum tokens required for component $i$

When the sum exceeds the maximum tokens, proportional adjustment is performed:

$$T_i' = \max\left(\left\lfloor T_i \cdot \frac{T_{\text{max}}}{T_{\text{total}}}\right\rfloor, T_{\text{min},i}\right)$$

Where $T_{\text{total}} = \sum_i T_i$ is the total allocation before adjustment.

Query complexity is determined by a weighted scoring function:

$$\text{complexity}(\text{query}) = \sum_i w_i \cdot f_i(\text{query})$$

Where $f_i$ are feature extractors that detect complexity factors (joins, aggregations, etc.), and $w_i$ are their respective weights.

**Novel Implementation Details:**

While many text-to-SQL systems use fixed context templates, our adaptive approach dynamically adjusts token allocation based on query complexity. This enables better utilization of the context window for complex queries.

The allocation percentages are dynamically determined based on the query complexity level:

| Component | Simple | Moderate | Complex |
|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Schema Summary | 40% | 50% | 60% |
| Examples | 25% | 20% | 15% |
| Query Patterns | 15% | 10% | 5% |
| Reasoning Chain | 10% | 10% | 10% |
| Common Mistakes | 5% | 5% | 5% |
| Type Constraints | 5% | 5% | 5% |

This adaptive allocation strategy gives more tokens to schema representation for complex queries (which involve more tables and joins) while providing more examples for simpler queries to improve clarity.

#### 4. Schema Analyzer Agent

The Schema Analyzer extracts and organizes database schema information into structured representations optimized for SQL generation.

**Mathematical Foundation:**

For column semantic tagging, we employ a probabilistic classification approach:

$$P(\text{tag} | \text{column}) = \frac{1}{Z} \sum_{p \in \text{patterns}} w_p \cdot \mathbf{1}[p \text{ matches column}]$$

Where $Z$ is a normalization factor and $w_p$ is the weight for pattern $p$.

For relationship inferencing, we build a weighted directed graph $G_R = (V_R, E_R)$ where:
- $V_R$ are tables in the schema
- $E_R$ are edges representing relationships with weights based on foreign key constraints

**Novel Implementation Details:**

The schema analyzer employs a multi-level detail representation system that adapts to the available token budget:

```
DetailLevel = {
    "low": BasicInfo + ColumnNames,
    "medium": BasicInfo + DetailedColumns + CommonConstraints,
    "high": BasicInfo + DetailedColumns + AllConstraints + SampleData + Relationships
}
```

This allows the system to provide appropriate schema context regardless of the complexity of the query or the number of tables involved.

#### 5. Ambiguity Resolver

The Ambiguity Resolver identifies and resolves ambiguities in natural language queries through a statistical analysis of query features.

**Mathematical Foundation:**

Ambiguity detection uses a confidence-impact model:

$$\text{needsResolution}(a) = \begin{cases} 
\text{True} & \text{if } \text{confidence}(a) < \tau_c \text{ and } \text{impact}(a) \geq \tau_i \\
\text{False} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

Where $\tau_c$ is the confidence threshold (default: 0.8) and $\tau_i$ is the impact threshold (default: 0.5).

For automatic resolution, we employ a Bayesian approach:

$$P(\text{option} | \text{context}) \propto P(\text{context} | \text{option}) \cdot P(\text{option})$$

Where $P(\text{option})$ is the prior probability based on historical query patterns.

**Novel Implementation Details:**

The system identifies 10 distinct types of ambiguities with specialized resolution strategies for each:

1. Column Reference Ambiguities
2. Table Reference Ambiguities
3. Aggregation Ambiguities
4. Filter Value Ambiguities
5. Join Path Ambiguities
6. Limit Ambiguities
7. Order Ambiguities
8. Grouping Ambiguities
9. Subquery Ambiguities
10. Temporal Ambiguities

For each ambiguity type, a tailored resolution strategy is employed, ranging from graph-based join path optimization to temporal reference normalization.

### System Processing Flow

The complete processing flow of the Alb-SQL system follows these steps:

1. **Query Analysis**:
   - Natural language parsing
   - Table detection
   - Ambiguity identification

2. **Context Generation**:
   - Complexity level determination
   - Token budget allocation
   - Schema information extraction
   - Resolution of identified ambiguities

3. **SQL Generation**:
   - Schema-aware prompt construction
   - Multiple candidate generation
   - Execution-based validation
   - Candidate ranking and selection

This can be formalized as a pipeline of transformations:

$$\text{Query} \xrightarrow{\phi_1} \text{ParsedQuery} \xrightarrow{\phi_2} \text{ContextualizedQuery} \xrightarrow{\phi_3} \text{CandidateQueries} \xrightarrow{\phi_4} \text{SQL}$$

Where each transformation $\phi_i$ represents a stage in the processing pipeline with its own set of operations and optimizations.

### Novel Contributions and Mathematical Foundations

Our approach differs from traditional text-to-SQL systems in several key ways, each with rigorous mathematical foundations:

#### 1. Chain-of-Schema Decomposition

Instead of directly translating natural language to SQL, we employ a multi-step reasoning process based on schema-guided decomposition:

$$\text{NL} \xrightarrow{\phi_{\text{tables}}} \text{T} \xrightarrow{\phi_{\text{columns}}} \text{T} \times \text{C} \xrightarrow{\phi_{\text{joins}}} \text{J} \xrightarrow{\phi_{\text{conditions}}} \text{SQL}$$

Where $\text{T}$ represents the set of tables, $\text{C}$ the set of columns, and $\text{J}$ the set of join conditions.

This approach has a theoretical foundation in hierarchical planning and reduces the problem complexity by breaking it into manageable sub-problems:

$$\text{complexity}(\phi_{\text{NL} \rightarrow \text{SQL}}) > \sum_i \text{complexity}(\phi_i)$$

#### 2. Cross-Database Meta-Learning

Traditional text-to-SQL systems train models for specific databases. Our approach enables zero-shot transfer across databases through analogical reasoning:

$$P(\text{SQL} | \text{NL}, \text{DB}_{\text{target}}) = \sum_{\text{DB}_{\text{source}}} P(\text{SQL} | \text{NL}, \text{DB}_{\text{source}}) \cdot P(\text{DB}_{\text{source}} \rightarrow \text{DB}_{\text{target}})$$

Where $P(\text{DB}_{\text{source}} \rightarrow \text{DB}_{\text{target}})$ is the transfer probability based on schema analogies.

#### 3. Execution-Aware Validation Loop

Most systems stop at SQL generation. We close the loop by validating execution results:

$$\text{SQL}^* = \arg\max_{\text{SQL} \in \text{Candidates}} \text{executionScore}(\text{SQL}, \text{DB})$$

This execution-aware optimization is formulated as a multi-objective function:

$$\text{executionScore}(\text{SQL}, \text{DB}) = \gamma_1 \cdot \text{correctness}(\text{SQL}) + \gamma_2 \cdot \text{efficiency}(\text{SQL}) + \gamma_3 \cdot \text{robustness}(\text{SQL})$$

With weights $\gamma_i$ tuned based on empirical performance.

### Why This Approach?

#### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **End-to-End Neural Translation**
   - Limitations: Poor generalization across databases, inability to understand complex schema relationships
   - Our Advantage: Schema-aware prompting with cross-database meta-learning

2. **Semantic Parsing with Intermediate Logic Forms**
   - Limitations: Does not incorporate execution feedback, rigid intermediate representations
   - Our Advantage: Direct optimization against execution results, flexible schema representation

3. **Grammar-Based Approaches**
   - Limitations: Limited to predefined grammatical structures, poor handling of ambiguity
   - Our Advantage: Explicit ambiguity resolution, adaptive context management

#### Mathematical Justification for Our Approach

The text-to-SQL problem can be formulated as finding the most probable SQL query given a natural language question and database schema:

$$\arg\max_{\text{SQL}} P(\text{SQL} | \text{NL}, \text{Schema})$$

Traditional approaches directly model this probability. We decompose it using Bayes' rule and Chain-of-Schema:

$$P(\text{SQL} | \text{NL}, \text{Schema}) = P(\text{Tables} | \text{NL}, \text{Schema}) \cdot P(\text{Columns} | \text{Tables}, \text{NL}, \text{Schema}) \cdot P(\text{Joins} | \text{Tables}, \text{Columns}, \text{NL}, \text{Schema}) \cdot ...$$

This decomposition:
1. Reduces the search space at each step
2. Allows incorporation of schema-specific knowledge
3. Enables more effective ambiguity resolution
4. Facilitates cross-database transfer learning

Our approach achieves a theoretical lower error bound than direct translation methods:

$$\mathbb{E}[\text{error}]_{\text{our approach}} \leq \mathbb{E}[\text{error}]_{\text{direct translation}} - \Delta$$

Where $\Delta$ represents the improvement due to schema-awareness and execution-based validation.

## Performance Metrics

The system achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Bird-SQL benchmark through:

1. **Schema Alignment Score (SAS)**: Measures how well the system aligns natural language elements with database schema elements
2. **Cross-Domain Transfer Test**: Evaluates the system's ability to transfer knowledge across different domains
3. **Plan Efficiency Ratio**: Assesses the efficiency of generated execution plans

These novel metrics provide a more comprehensive evaluation than traditional text-to-SQL metrics like exact match accuracy.
